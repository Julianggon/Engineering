    <h2>SEPTEMBER 2, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p> Monday we were introduced and learned more about mechanical engineering. Wednedsay: We were introduced to tinkercad and learned the basics of the website. Friday: We were challenged to recreate a kitchen appliance on tinkercad. I recreated a mini oven with 3 pizzas.</h9> 
    
    <h2>September 16, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p>Monday we had a sub and worked on our tinkercad/rude goldberg project. We decided to use Justins Rube Goldberg model because it was the most realistic option for building a model in class. We continued this project and got the majority of the build done in class on Thursday with only one ramp and the string contraption left to assemble. Today was a challenge day. We were challenged with the task of building a boat that could carry weight and float for 5 minutes. We learned the best boat is just a flat piece of paper with weight divided evenly.<h/9>
    
    <h2>September 23, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we focused on finishing up our Rube Goldberg machine. We were the first to test ours and it was not efficient at first and did not pop the balloon. Once we added a wall to the lower ramp, the ball was able to more consistently head in the right direction and we were able to pop the balloon on our third attempt of our first revision of the model. The tinkercad and our model can be seen below:</h9>
