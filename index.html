    <h2>September 16, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p></h9>Monday we had a sub and worked on our tinkercad/rude goldberg project. We decided to use Justins Rube Goldberg model because it was the most realistic option for building a model in class. We continued this project and got the majority of the build done in class on Thursday with only one ramp and the string contraption left to assemble. Today was a challenge day. We were challenged with the task of building a boat that could carry weight and float for 5 minutes. We learned the best boat is just a flat piece of paper with weight divided evenly.<h/9>
