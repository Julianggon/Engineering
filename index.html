    <h2>AUGUST 24, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p> Created Website and learned different tags. Learned "marquee" tag to create moving text. Pushed code to Github and website is blocked.</h9>

    <h2>SEPTEMBER 2, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p> Monday we were introduced and learned more about mechanical engineering. Wednedsay: We were introduced to tinkercad and learned the basics of the website. Friday: We were challenged to recreate a kitchen appliance on tinkercad. I recreated a mini oven with 3 pizzas.</h9> 
    
    <h2>September 16, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p>Monday we had a sub and worked on our tinkercad/rude goldberg project. We decided to use Justins Rube Goldberg model because it was the most realistic option for building a model in class. We continued this project and got the majority of the build done in class on Thursday with only one ramp and the string contraption left to assemble. Today was a challenge day. We were challenged with the task of building a boat that could carry weight and float for 5 minutes. We learned the best boat is just a flat piece of paper with weight divided evenly.<h/9>
    
    <h2>September 23, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we focused on finishing up our Rube Goldberg machine. We were the first to test ours and it was not efficient at first and did not pop the balloon. Once we added a wall to the lower ramp, the ball was able to more consistently head in the right direction and we were able to pop the balloon on our third attempt of our first revision of the model. The tinkercad and our model can be seen below:</h9>

    <h2>September 30, 2022:</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we dissected computers all the way to the mother board. After we finished dissecting, we labeled the motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, hard drive, WiFi Module, Fan, Heat Sink, Disk Drive, Audio, and Battery. After this, we put back together the comuter which was the hardest part of the process because we were missing some screws and had to remember which screws went where. Short video showing our final result: </h9>

    <h2>October 7, 2022</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we started our bioengineering unit and created prosthetics for animals on tinkercad. My prosthetic was a duck leg. I started off with a rubber deck, then added a chick leg already in tinkercad. I then began to look up duck prosthetic legs for ideas and used one of the images I found as a model for my duck leg. On Friday, we had a challenge to write instructions for making a peanut butter sandwich. The person reading and acting out the instructions would act it out literally so the instructions had to be very clear, detailed, and account for things like opening the jar or even placing the bread a certin way. </h9>

    <h2>October 14, 2022</h2>
    <h9><p>We spent this week creating our bottle rockets design and began construction. We designed the bottle with tinkercad and came up with our supplies for the bottle rocket: two bottles, cardboard for our fins, a lot of duct tape to secure everything, a payload made up of the second bottle which contained our parachute made of a garbage bag. When the rocket is up in the air, the lid of the bottle rocket should come off, releasing the parachute and saving the rocket. The rocket will be sent up using water pressure from a pump. </h9>
    
    <h2>October 21, 2022</h2>
    <h9><p>We finsihed the construction of our bottle rocket and it looked the most functional of all the bottle rockets. However, our rocket had a leak and failed to withstand the water pressure to launch off. If we had secured the body of the bottle rocket more firmly and we were more precise with our cuts, this could have been a preventable mistake.</h9>
  
    <h2>November 4, 2022</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we focused on electrical engineering but especially on circuit boards. We learned about voltages, currrents, and resitance to help us build a foundation for us to apply when we actually work hands on with circuit boards. We used tinkercad to get a feel for circuit boards using power sources like batteries, resistors, and wires, we were able to light up LED lights in different ways. At first we lit up only one, then multiple, then multiple in a row. An image of our final result can be seen below:</h9>

    <h2>November 10, 2022</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we worked on circuit boards but real! We tried to relicate the same labs as we did on tinkercad and were able to do the first lab and make the led turn on. For thee other labs we did not have enough voltage to light up all 3 LEDs like we did on tinkercad. We had a total of 5 different circuits we had to replicate and for each we measured the voltage. On thursday we had a challenge day in which we had to argue whether we would take a math class or write #s from 1 to 1 million. After doing the calculations, taking a math class takes up significantly less number of hours but still takes a full school year(180 hours), whereas writing the numbers takes 818 hours but can be completed in 34 days or saced out and completed with time to spare before the math class would have been completed. </h9>

    <h2>December 20, 2022</h2>
    <h9><p>For the last few weeks we have been working on creating and testing spaghetti bridges. We started off by creating a sketch, tinkercad and begnning our first design. Our first design took a total of 2 days to build and was able to hold a cup full of water total. Our second design, we applied too much glue which resulted in the noodles becoming too bendy and breaking. Our third and last was made by Xander so it is going to be our best model.</h9>
    
    <h2>February 24, 2023</h2>
    <h9><p>For the past several weeks we have been creating an arduino car. We began by writing out a proposal of an introduction to our arduino car and a build of materials for what we will need, as well as short descriptions of each member. We began our research by looking up other typical arduino cars and most generally consisted of arduino, motors, wheels, sensors, and wheels. However, for our arduino, we had to build the body and use a bread board to power the car itself. The motor driver connects directly to the arduino but does not have much power. We struggled with creating our second pair of wheels on our own. We utilized CD discs and covered them in tape to make them roll smoother. We then taped several straws together and fit the CDs around them to attach to the car itself. Our main problem with this, was that the CD wheels were too flimsly and caused the car to slow down or not move at all. To fix this we added popsicle sticks to both sides of each CD that were taped to the straws and the CDs would be allowed less movement because of the lesser space. Today we are working on soldering our wires from the breadboard to the gear motors. </h9>

    <h2>March 7, 2023</h2>
    <h9><p>We tested our arduinos but we had a couple of problems. Firstly, our back wheels were slightly too high which were causing the arduino car to drag slightly and it was moving slowly as a result. In addition to this, our motors were moving slower than other cars. This could have been because of the batteries not having enough power or because of the weight of the car. In the end, our car was able to move in a straight line but was slower than most other cars.</h9>

    <h2>March 24, 2023</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we have started a two week project revolved around the egg drop. Our group, consisting of 5 members, decided on a prototype that covered the egg in a staw like cage to make it lightweight and less likely to break. We also included cotton balls in our sketch for additional support so the egg does not break in the straws from the force of the drop. Lastly we decided to make a parachute for our egg drop to slow down the fall. Hopefully with all of these precautions, the egg will survive the drop. Today we made a tinkercad showing the design of the egg in addition to the parachute.</h9>

    <h2>March 31, 2023</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we completed the egg drop project. As a result of our parachute, the egg drop was slowed done enough so that the egg did not crack. Once we took the parachute away, the fall was significantly faster and the egg ended up cracking.</h9>

    <h2>April 7, 2023</h2>
    <h9><p>This week we started a new project to build a cardboard boat that will float with two people in it and be able to travel across the pool. One of the major challenges of this project is to make the boat stay afloat with the 2 people for a long duration of time. We started off with just the design which is a rectanglar box that has an upward sloping triangle in the front to hopefully aid us in not drowning. Additionally, we designed the tinkercad for this project and we will be building the project throughout the next couple of weeks.</h9>
    
    <h2>April20, 2023</h2>
    <h9><p>For the past 2 weeks, we have been in the process of building our cardboard boat. The cardboard that we can use is limited which slowed the process down but we have cut out cardboard with the correct dimensions for the base, the walls, and the the lifted triangle. We have to wait a bit for the duct tape to come in before we can fully assemble the boat.</h9>
